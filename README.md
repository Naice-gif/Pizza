La casa de pizza project is an independent project where one is required to use skills required,mainly bootstrap,javascript,html and css and more techniques acquired from JQuery.Create a web application that helps customers acquire their pizzas online having to go to the house of the pizza in person. they place their orders and get a summary of what they asked for and then require for a delivery.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
Github Terminal Visual Code

## Project setup instructions
To have access on this project use the following commands: git clone https://github.com/Naice-gif/Pizza

## BDD
When the user input his/her requirements,there comes a summary of what they need and the price to be paid!!
The pages are three: The front pages which contains buttons for the menu page and the ordering platfrom, When you get to the other pages and you want to reach the front pages, all you have to do is click on the site's logo and it takes you back to the front.

The javascript part is not well done and not as clean, it still needs more work.
